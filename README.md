# my-smarthome-application

Project: BSmart
Author: Alexander Beers

Description: I built this program to experiment interfacing with external devices and to make a rough copy of a smart home style application. To do this I chose to build an app which would interface with my home's phillips hue lighting and display some information about what my main computer is currently doing. To give this app a true 'smarthome feel' I built it for a raspberry pi configured with an 800 x 480 touch screen display. The app is capable of obtaining date, time, temperature, weather conditions, turning on/off lights on a phillips hue bridge system, changing the color and brightness of lights on a phillips hue light system, and monitoring my main pc's temperature and load.

Note: The weather, phillips bridge connection, and pc log file URLs are hardcoded into the software and are not modifiable through gui.

Built with Java 8 using JavaFX GUI Library.
